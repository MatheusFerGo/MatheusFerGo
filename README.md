# Hello, I'm Matheus! 👋

### About Me

I work with technology by combining two passions: software development and data analysis. My journey has taken me from creating Python automations that optimize daily business routines to building robust APIs with .NET.  

I always aim to use my skills to build software that not only works but is also intuitive and improves people’s lives, while staying in life-long-learning mode. For me, every new project is an opportunity to evolve, discover new technologies, and become a better professional. I believe that the best solution is one that is elegant, simple, efficient, and solves a real problem. That’s why I dedicate myself to studying and applying best practices such as **SOLID**, **Clean Code**, and **DDD** in everything I do.

### 🌱 Projects I'm working on

I am developing a few study projects: **BarberBoss API** and **CashFlow API**. 
These are complete RESTful APIs in .NET designed to apply my knowledge in layered architecture, DDD, and unit testing in a real-world scenario.  
It has been an incredible challenge where I was able to manage the entire project lifecycle — from conception to deployment on Azure.
