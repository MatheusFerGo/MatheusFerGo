### About Me

I work with technology by combining two passions: software development and data analysis. My journey has taken me from creating Python automations that optimize daily business routines to building robust APIs with .NET.  

I always aim to use my skills to build software that not only works but is also intuitive and improves people’s lives, while staying in life-long-learning mode. For me, every new project is an opportunity to evolve, discover new technologies, and become a better professional. I believe that the best solution is one that is elegant, simple, efficient, and solves a real problem. That’s why I dedicate myself to studying and applying best practices such as **SOLID**, **Clean Code**, and **DDD** in everything I do.

### 🌱 Projects I'm working on

I am developing a few study projects:

**[LeetSync](https://github.com/MatheusFerGo/LeetSync)** - My personal hub for continuous evolution in algorithms and data structures. It serves as a synchronized repository for my LeetCode solutions across multiple languages (C#, Python, and SQL), focused on maintaining a clean, automated, and organized history of my problem-solving journey.

**[FIAP - Techchallenge](https://github.com/MatheusFerGo/CustomerServiceTest)** - is a robust RESTful API developed as part of my Postgraduate journey. This project serves as a laboratory for Domain-Driven Design (DDD), layered architecture, and comprehensive unit testing. Is also a microservice, part of ControlePedidos repository.

### 🎤 Languages I speak

My native language is **Portuguese**, and I also speak **English** at an advanced level (C1) and **Spanish** at an intermediate level (B1).  
We can easily communicate in any of these three languages!
